# book-recommender-backend
This backend powers a personalized book recommendation system tailored to my own reading preferences. It uses data from the Google Books API combined with my Goodreads reviews to build a profile of books I like. Leveraging FastAPI, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity, the system analyzes book features and user preferences to generate relevant and customized book suggestions.
